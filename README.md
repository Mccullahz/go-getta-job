# Go Getta Job
- This project is a Go powered TUI application that finds nearby business websites and searches them for career or job listing pages. The goal is to automate localized job hunting by surfacing hiring pages often buried in small business websites. By searching only these local businesses, applicants can find job opportunities that may not be listed on larger job boards, reducing resume traffic and potentially aiding in landing a desired position.
